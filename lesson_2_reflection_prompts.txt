What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates the git repository out of the directory that you are in and it adds .git directory. You need to do it if you want to create a brand new git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	 The staging area is different in that you don't make the actual changes while in the staging
	 directory, nor is it the place that you make snapshots of. It's where you get to organize
	 and categorize which files get to belong to any particular commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	If you have you multiple logical changes in your working directory,
	you have to make sure that the changes you add to the staging area are for
	one logical commit only. Then you commit those changes and repeat for
	each logical commit you have made. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	One situation would be when you're developing a new experimental feature. Another 
	situation could be when you want to create a version that is used only for testing.
